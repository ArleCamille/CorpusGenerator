# Text recognition data generator from bitmap
Generates sample text from bitmap font.

Source code mostly copied over from Belval's [TextRecognitionDataGenerator](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator).

Since this program was mostly designed with my use cases in mind, it has some hardcoded values and inconvenient things.
